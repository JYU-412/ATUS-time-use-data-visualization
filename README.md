# ATUS-time-use-data-visualization
Using R for Data visualization of American Time Use Data.

This project is based on a study examining changes in time use patterns in social engagement of US older adults before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (2019-2021). I am interested in how does social engagement shift from pre-pandemic to pandemic periods among adults aged 60 and older by location and activity type.

I drew data from American Time Use Survey (ATUS) from 2019 to 2021 to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adultsâ€™ social engagement.
